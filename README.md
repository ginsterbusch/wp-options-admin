WpOptionsAdmin
==============

Simple overview of ALL available options, stored in the wp_options table. Basically an improved options.php.
Only meant for developers, ie. you should know what you're doing!

The plugin name is a spoof on "PhpMyAdmin".

Planned features:
- add, edit and delete options
- search for a specific option name or value
- switch between pure "text" and form field-packed view
